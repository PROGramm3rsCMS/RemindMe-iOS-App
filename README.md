## Overview
### Description
Users will have the ability to create and check off a daily to-do list.
The app can help users stay on task, personally or professionally.  

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Productivity
- **Mobile:** Primary efforts for the app would be for mobile development 
since the app could utilize push notifications and provide real-time 
data (completion of a task).  However, the app could offer some practical 
applications on a computer, like quickly adding or completing a task.  
As a reminder, the mobile version will contain more robust features, but 
the team will provide support for computer use.
- **Story:** Users will have the ability to create and manage their daily 
tasks.  Users can mark off the completion of each job once the desired 
task is executed.  If users have any unfinished tasks, they can decide to 
move them to the next calendar date.
- **Market:** Any group, including students, stay-at-home parents, and 
professionals, can use the app. Currently, the app does not have any 
social features. However, to provide some level of safety, users under the 
age of 13 would require parental, guardian, or adult permission.
- **Habit:** The app requires high-level interaction from users since users 
are the ones creating and marking the completion of daily tasks.  This daily 
requirement to mark off any job completion could make habit-forming interaction 
since users can visualize increased productivity and organization.  Users' 
personality types and how organized users are will determine the users' 
frequency or infrequency.
- **Scope:** At the project's inception, users will have access to create 
multiple daily tasks and mark the completion of daily tasks, along with the 
chance to move incomplete tasks to the next day.  The evolution of the app could 
lead to a productivity-sharing application, which could increase downloads.  
Sharing accomplishments and milestones could potentially lead to using social 
media apps like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter.
